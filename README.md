AgriTrace is a comprehensive solution for verifying organic fruit claims using IoT, blockchain, and cloud technology. Our system collects real-time data from multiple soil sensors (pH, moisture, temperature, etc.) to ensure transparency in organic farming. The sensor data is averaged and stored in Firebase, which then triggers an automated process to record the data on the blockchain using Ganache for secure and tamper-proof storage.
A web-based dashboard provides detailed insights into product conditions, accessible via QR codes for easy verification. Beyond this, our solution extends to cold storage management and supply chain optimization, enhancing traceability and quality control in the agricultural sector. Our research-backed approach ensures a scalable and reliable system for organic certification and farm-to-fork transparency.
